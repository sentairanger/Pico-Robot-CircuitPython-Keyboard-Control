# Pico-Robot-CircuitPython-Keyboard-Control

## Introduction

This is a fun project to turn a Pico into a keyboard emulator that can control a robot. The `code.py` file is used by the Pico to emulate the keyboard. To download and add CircuitPython follow this [link](https://circuitpython.org/board/raspberry_pi_pico/). The `robot-control.py` and `robot-camera.py` code files are used as example code to control a robot with the emulator.
